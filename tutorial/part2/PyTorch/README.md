# Introduction to PyTorch on Alvis
This will introduce the very basics of using PyTorch on Alvis.

The dataset we will construct ourselves and the model will be a simple linear regression model.

## Set-up
For the following excercises you will need to load the following modules:
```bash
flat_modules
ml PyTorch/1.9.0-fosscuda-2020b matplotlib/3.3.3-fosscuda-2020b JupyterLab/2.2.8-GCCcore-10.2.0
```

## Introduction
In this part simply get yourself acquainted with the existing examples `regression.py` and `regression.ipynb`. Note that the notebook may not be very readable in its raw text format is better explored when running a jupyter notebook.

### Excercises
1. Run `python regression.py`
2. Run `jupyter lab` and go through `regression.ipynb`
