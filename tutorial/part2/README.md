In this part we will implement a very simple regression model on a very simple dataset using a single GPU. See respective subfolder for specific instructions for each language or library.

## Opening a Jupyter Notebook
In this part you will have the possibility to use a Jupyter Notebook to follow along some of the examples and excersices.

You can find some details on how to do this in the [C3SE documentation](https://www.c3se.chalmers.se/documentation/applications/jupyter/).
