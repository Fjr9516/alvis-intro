# Introduction to ML on Alvis
In this part we will implement a very simple regression model on a very simple
dataset using a single GPU. See below for specific instructions
for each language or library.

## Opening a Jupyter Notebook
In this part you will have the possibility to use a Jupyter Notebook to follow
along some of the examples and excersices.

You can find some details on how to do this in the [C3SE
documentation](https://www.c3se.chalmers.se/documentation/applications/jupyter/).

## PyTorch
For the following excercises you will need to load the following modules:
```bash
flat_modules
ml PyTorch/1.9.0-fosscuda-2020b matplotlib/3.3.3-fosscuda-2020b JupyterLab/2.2.8-GCCcore-10.2.0
```

Now you should open up `regression-pytorch.ipynb` and follow the instructions there.
