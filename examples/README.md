# Examples
Here are some examples that are similar to what is taught in the tutorial and
while the tutorial primary way to introduce yourself to ML on Alvis, these
examples can perhaps give a new perspective.

0. Accessing Alvis
1. Getting started on Alvis
2. Using available datasets
3. Downloading datasets with Torchvision
4. Using multiple GPUs
5. Profiling with TensorBoard
6. Checkpointing your models
7. Distributed training accross nodes with Horovod
8. Distributed training accross nodes with Horovod and PyTorch
