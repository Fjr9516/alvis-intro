# Alvis introduction
This repository contains examples of jobscript for TensorFlow for running on the SNIC Alvis AI/ML HPC system.
The aim is to get let users get their feet wet quickly with something that they can adapt into their own jobs.

Accompaning slides are available at:

## Tutorial overview
The tutorials are written for PyTorch and Tensorflow and the ideas from one should be able to be used in the other.

1. Getting started on Alvis
2. Using available datasets
3. Downloading datasets with Torchvision
4. Using multiple GPUs
5. Profiling with TensorBoard
6. Checkpointing your models
7. Distributed training accross nodes with Horovod
8. Distributed training accross nodes with Horovod and PyTorch
