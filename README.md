# Alvis introduction
This repository contains examples and excercises for how to run ML applications on the
SNIC Alvis AI/ML HPC system. The aim is to get let users get their feet wet
quickly with something that they can adapt into their own jobs.

The examples are written in Python with the frameworks TensorFlow and PyTorch. More
frameworks can be added if interest exists.

Accompaning slides are available at:

## Tutorial overview
Doing the excercises are voluntary, but make sure to read the associated READMEs for
each part to make sure that you're not missing something.
